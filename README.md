# Road Sign Detection using Yolov5

Welcome to the Road Sign Detection project using Yolov5! This GitHub repository provides you with the necessary code and instructions to detect traffic signs in images. With the help of this project, you can train your own model to detect and classify different types of road signs.

The main steps involved in this project are:

Downloading the dataset: The dataset used in this project is available in @andrewmvd's collection. You can easily download it by following the instructions provided in the notebook.

Converting annotations: The annotations in the dataset are in the Pascal VOC format, but Yolov5 requires them in the YOLO format. The notebook guides you through the process of converting the annotations to the required format.

Rendering bounding boxes: To visualize the detected road signs, the notebook uses OpenCV and Matplotlib libraries. You will be able to see the bounding boxes around the detected signs directly within the notebook.

Feel free to explore the code and make any modifications as per your requirements. Happy coding!
